# Titanic-Random-Forest

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset available.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- Pclass: Ticket class
- Sex: Gender of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Fare: Ticket fare

The target variable is:
- Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately `X%` on the test set. The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
